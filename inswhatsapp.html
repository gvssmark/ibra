10/23/22, 8:46 AM - VSP-G RAMACHANDRA RAO(615): Dear friends, Good Evening, We understand that few members are expressing that what is the use of CLC meeting outcome as it is unlikely to provide any relief to the retirees opting for IBA Group Medical Insurance Scheme for the year 2022-23. In this context, we wish to inform that as a responsible apex organisation of the bank retirees, AIBRF has been initiating all the required steps to put pressure on the concerned to pay required attention to make Group Health Insurance Scheme more *affordable* and *inclusive*. The recent CLC meeting was a break through as it is an opportunity for us to represent our case in a proper platform. Though it may not provide any relief immediately, definately it paves the pay to bring improvements in the scheme in the ensuing years. Our endeavour is to have *single policy* for existing and retired employees,  introduction of *minimum health insurance policy* for all retired employees and the premium is to be borne by the banks, or alternatively extend *uniform subsidy* across the Banks. Members are requested to understand the constraints under which the retiree associations are operating. Let us have patience and perseverance to achieve our long pending genuine demands. Thanks and Regards,  Nsn Reddy GS ABREA

10/23/22, 9:36 AM - OTH-EAB-JAYANT KUMAR PANDEY (1037): No doubt Sir the efforts are worth appreciation,  but an institution like IBA has not been able to work in positive direction of desires of Honble FM of India, do we really believe that IBA would act inbthe lines of any instructions or directives of CLC. CLC has been doing good job by way of meeting UFBU to withdraw strikes called by them, but reasons of strikes have never been addressed.  It has been happening for last 40 50 years. Can CLC do anything for retired bankers.

10/23/22, 10:24 AM - OTH-EAB-MANOHAR LAL KANDWAL (1298): The premium is very  high because retired are treated separately. While the bank has been paying premium for entire service period at low premium,but not taking a integrated approach retired  persons premium is very high but management takes policy at the time of entrance of an employee and negotiate that the policy will continue after retirement also no doubt by paying slight higher premium but after retirement same policy will continue till the death of an employee. I donot think why it is not considered ,and it may be pointed out to UFBU and IBA.

As long as Finance Ministry is willing to provide any benefit to the retired Bank personnel (even the serving Bank personnel) nothing will become a reality of all our dreams.
All these Players such as IBA, UFBU etc. are just puppets.
10/23/22, 11:45 AM - OTH-EAB-MANOHAR LAL KANDWAL (1298): Think and act in a positive way ,solution will be there.If some one takes a personal  health policy at a age of 25 years continues it for 30 years ,than even after the age of 60 years the insurance premium will be slightly higher and policy will continue, the same is the case here only premium will be borne by the retiree.
10/23/22, 11:51 AM - OTH-EAB-RABINDRA NATH SAHAY (1026): because there is no one in ufbu to represent retirees ... and ufbu is making settlement for retirees ...

Data is sorted on SR Number

Out of the 138 applications filled in 48 are reconciled with Bank Statement.
Online remittance using Internet Banking / UPI Payments Were automatically reconciled.

Many of the Offline applications (NEFT) were unreconciled. 
The reason identified is NEFT Reference number.
Reference number is having 10 digits in the data and actual reference number is 12 digits.
Last 2 digits are missing in the data. KMD will make efforts to reconcile the data.

Some of the applicants have just filled in the data and they have not made the payment. Such applications are also furnished in the list.

We are expecting data again today and hope many applications will be reconciled.

10/19/22, 6:25 AM - OTH-PRADIP TARAN (1420): The problem arises from the fact that NEFT reference number had *5 alphabetic characters* in the beginning. However, *the online form only accepted numerical characters*. In addition to that, Indian Bank UTR number is 16 character long. However, the online form accepted 10 characters on the relevant field. Hence, the mismatch. Example: my NEFT UTR number was *IDIBH22290340542*. However, the form accepted 2229034054 only. The reconciliation will be a challenge for KMD. *We can help by providing the actual UTR number separately to them, wherever available.* Please, convey this message to KMD.

When the Branch was authorised to debit premium amount  for IBA policy in the afternoon by me ( cheque is not acceptable) ,  the Officer later  called me    thrice  (  mobile of mine  was kept  in silent mode during the afternoon siesta  due to travails of  time lag) and on calling him back informs me  first  about ' insufficient balance '. When reminded him that the balance kept in my SB account would be sufficient to meet double the amount of the premium,  he immediately retorts  as if it is probably the mistake on my part to keep such balance that could enable the system debit my account twice with the premium amount  with impunity and still calling  ' insufficient balance' or so that prompted the Officer to alert me.  When met  in person , it was given to understand that the amount was sent for the credit towards renewal premium of  my Policy relating to the same SR number twice  and thus  a request was sent to HO HRM  for the  reversal  of the  extraneous  debit entry.

10/19/22, 5:47 AM - GVSSMARK: Data received from KMD is ported here.
Data is sorted on SR Number

Out of the 138 applications filled in 48 are reconciled with Bank Statement.
Online remittance using Internet Banking / UPI Payments Were automatically reconciled.

Many of the Offline applications (NEFT) were unreconciled. 
The reason identified is NEFT Reference number.
Reference number is having 10 digits in the data and actual reference number is 12 digits.
Last 2 digits are missing in the data. KMD will make efforts to reconcile the data.

Some of the applicants have just filled in the data and they have not made the payment. Such applications are also furnished in the list.

We are expecting data again today and hope many applications will be reconciled.


https://gvssmark.github.io/ibra/ins2223.html
10/19/22, 6:18 AM - GVSSMARK: If the reference number is tallying with out last two digits, KMD will reconcile.
10/19/22, 6:22 AM - GVSSMARK: Check for correctness of other data. If any modifications are to be done, inform us.

10/23/22, 8:46 AM - VSP-G RAMACHANDRA RAO(615): Dear friends, Good Evening, We understand that few members are expressing that what is the use of CLC meeting outcome as it is unlikely to provide any relief to the retirees opting for IBA Group Medical Insurance Scheme for the year 2022-23. In this context, we wish to inform that as a responsible apex organisation of the bank retirees, AIBRF has been initiating all the required steps to put pressure on the concerned to pay required attention to make Group Health Insurance Scheme more *affordable* and *inclusive*. The recent CLC meeting was a break through as it is an opportunity for us to represent our case in a proper platform. Though it may not provide any relief immediately, definately it paves the pay to bring improvements in the scheme in the ensuing years. Our endeavour is to have *single policy* for existing and retired employees,  introduction of *minimum health insurance policy* for all retired employees and the premium is to be borne by the banks, or alternatively extend *uniform subsidy* across the Banks. Members are requested to understand the constraints under which the retiree associations are operating. Let us have patience and perseverance to achieve our long pending genuine demands. Thanks and Regards,  Nsn Reddy GS ABREA

10/19/22, 5:47 AM - GVSSMARK: Data received from KMD is ported here.
Data is sorted on SR Number

Out of the 138 applications filled in 48 are reconciled with Bank Statement.
Online remittance using Internet Banking / UPI Payments Were automatically reconciled.

Many of the Offline applications (NEFT) were unreconciled. 
The reason identified is NEFT Reference number.
Reference number is having 10 digits in the data and actual reference number is 12 digits.
Last 2 digits are missing in the data. KMD will make efforts to reconcile the data.

Some of the applicants have just filled in the data and they have not made the payment. Such applications are also furnished in the list.

We are expecting data again today and hope many applications will be reconciled.


https://gvssmark.github.io/ibra/ins2223.html
10/19/22, 6:18 AM - GVSSMARK: If the reference number is tallying with out last two digits, KMD will reconcile.

4 Dt of remittance: 17/10/22

5 Data was filled in and application was submitted to KMD and I received acknowledgament to my email id. 

6 On verification of contents in application I find the *UTR no is wrongly mentioned as 2229032179 and last digit is missing. Correct UTR no is 22290321796*

7 I sent an email to KMD highlighting the above. I spoke to Mr Narasimhamurthy' KMD representative in Visakhapatnam and sent WhatsApp messages also. Still the matter is hanging fire.

8 Even after a lapse of 3 working days my name is not appearing in the latest list fowarded today in *either reconciled or unreconciled.*

10 There is a sequence of 4 holidays for DIWALI. When will they reconcile. I have my own doubts about their capabilities. Ask KMD team not create  anxious moments for retirees. Let them deploy more people to do this job. How about other bank retirees fate is a big question in my mind.

11 I may be wrong, yet, *Sorry to say this it is time TEAM IBRA SPEAKS TO  KMD PEOPLE STERNLY.*

10/23/22, 8:45 AM - VSP-G RAMACHANDRA RAO(615): Dear friends, Good Evening, We understand that few members are expressing that what is the use of CLC meeting outcome as it is unlikely to provide any relief to the retirees opting for IBA Group Medical Insurance Scheme for the year 2022-23. In this context, we wish to inform that as a responsible apex organisation of the bank retirees, AIBRF has been initiating all the required steps to put pressure on the concerned to pay required attention to make Group Health Insurance Scheme more *affordable* and *inclusive*. The recent CLC meeting was a break through as it is an opportunity for us to represent our case in a proper platform. Though it may not provide any relief immediately, definately it paves the pay to bring improvements in the scheme in the ensuing years. Our endeavour is to have *single policy* for existing and retired employees,  introduction of *minimum health insurance policy* for all retired employees and the premium is to be borne by the banks, or alternatively extend *uniform subsidy* across the Banks. Members are requested to understand the constraints under which the retiree associations are operating. Let us have patience and perseverance to achieve our long pending genuine demands. Thanks and Regards,  Nsn Reddy GS ABREA

Data is sorted on SR Number

Out of the 138 applications filled in 48 are reconciled with Bank Statement.
Online remittance using Internet Banking / UPI Payments Were automatically reconciled.

Many of the Offline applications (NEFT) were unreconciled. 
The reason identified is NEFT Reference number.
Reference number is having 10 digits in the data and actual reference number is 12 digits.
Last 2 digits are missing in the data. KMD will make efforts to reconcile the data.

Some of the applicants have just filled in the data and they have not made the payment. Such applications are also furnished in the list.

We are expecting data again today and hope many applications will be reconciled.

10/19/22, 9:48 AM - HYD-H S PATRA (1098): I might not be able to attend the meeting @ Hotel Sidhartha . A Few points to ponder in the meeting.

The percentage increase in premium is 53% in case of NIA / CBREA/IBRA and 26% in NI / IBA Policy over last year . In absolute terms the gap between the two policies is reduced to 13 K from last year‚Äôs 18 K. 
Co-pay restriction of 50% in case of Laser surgery is unmitigated burden. Laser surgery is now part of conventional / traditional surgery to reduce haemorrhage, pinpoint excision and reduced time for surgery . It facilitates quicker healing . In IBA scheme full reimbursement is allowed. NIA can reimburse up to 1 lac 75 , 50 , 25 K without co-pay for base policy of 4,3,2,1 lac respectively. That would take care of small laser surgeries without burden .Robotic surgery , Stem cell therapy ,Cochaelior implant are costly, so co-pay clause is understandable. Laparoscopic and Laser surgery is very common now a days.

EMI for premium borrowing @18% is high . It could be reduced to help the Retirees. 

The problems with Retirees are low pension. high medical cost ,high cost of living , and uncertain future . So, benefits should come now.

10/20/22, 11:57 PM - HYD-K CHANDRA MOULI(183): First of all, this is not a forum for general messages, as advised by the officials of the association. Let us stick to insurance messages for which it is temporarily opened up.
However, a wrong needs correction. Here is the truth about Sir:
"Sir is a formal honorific address in English for men, derived from Sire in the High Middle Ages. Both are derived from the old French "Sieur" (Lord), brought to England in 1066 by the French-speaking Normans, and which now exist in French only as part of "Monsieur", with the equivalent "My Lord" in English. Traditionally, as governed by law and custom, Sir is used for men titled as knights, often as members of orders of chivalry, as well as later applied to baronets and other offices."
10/21/22, 7:17 AM - HYD-KAVURI SRINIVAS(539): I have also seen in some very old book, Sir is given as Sire...
10/21/22, 8:32 AM - HYD-A SATYENDRA NATH DIXIT(836): I have remitted the premium through SBI by NEFT and while filling up the form find SBI name is not there in the list of Banks after filling UTR. As suggested I put the bank name as Indian Bank and filled the 16 number UTR still it is asking for some more digits and not proceeding further to submit - It is also strange that Bank name like SBI is not there but names such as Andhra Bank, Allahabad Bank Syndicate Bank which are not in existence are finding place in the list- A S Dixit
10/21/22, 9:01 AM - GVSSMARK: While developing the webpage, they should have the assistance of a banking domain people. 
What has already happened can be rectified in future only. At this stage, we can only force match the transaction.
